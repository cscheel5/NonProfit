        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>Take Me Out To The Ballgame is a non-profit organization that helps little kids achieve their dreams.
            We work with young baseball players to help them get tickets to a MLB Game. They will be able to attend the games along with other young ballplayers. We want to grant all
            little league baseball players the gift to be able to watch their favorite pro players.  Contact us if you and your ballplayer are having issues attending a game.</p>
